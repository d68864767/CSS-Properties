/* CSS Framework Customization */

/* Theming and Skinning */
/* Many CSS frameworks provide a way to customize their default styles to match your own design. 
   This is often done through a combination of CSS variables, custom classes, and preprocessor features like mixins and functions. 
   Here's an example of how you might customize the primary color in Bootstrap: */

/*
:root {
  --bs-primary: #ff6347; /* Tomato */
}

.btn-primary {
  background-color: var(--bs-primary);
}
*/

/* Custom Components */
/* In addition to customizing existing components, you might also want to create your own components that fit in with the rest of your framework. 
   This can be done by extending existing classes and adding your own styles. 
   Here's an example of a custom button component in Bootstrap: */

/*
.btn-custom {
  background-color: var(--bs-primary);
  border: none;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 32px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 16px;
  margin: 4px 2px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
*/

/* Integration with JavaScript */
/* Many CSS frameworks also include JavaScript plugins that add additional functionality to their components. 
   You can customize these plugins by passing options to their initialization functions, or by using their API methods in your own scripts. 
   Here's an example of initializing a Bootstrap modal with custom options: */

/*
$('#myModal').modal({
  backdrop: 'static',
  keyboard: false
})
*/

/* Dynamic CSS Generation */
/* With the help of CSS-in-JS libraries, you can generate CSS dynamically based on component state, props, or global theme. 
   Here's an example of dynamic CSS generation with styled-components: */

/*
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${props => props.primary ? 'palevioletred' : 'white'};
  color: ${props => props.primary ? 'white' : 'palevioletred'};
`;

<Button primary>Primary Button</Button>
<Button>Default Button</Button>
*/

/* Note: For all these customizations, you would typically write them in your own CSS file, 
   and then include that file after the framework's CSS file in your HTML file. 
   This ensures that your custom styles override the framework's default styles. */
