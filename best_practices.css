/* CSS organization and naming conventions (BEM, SMACSS) */
/* Following BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention */

/* Block component */
.block {
    color: #333;
}

/* Element that depends upon the block */ 
.block__element {
    color: #666;
}

/* Modifier that changes the style of the block */
.block--modifier {
    color: #999;
}

/* Minification and compression */
/* This is a process that is usually done in the build process with tools like Gulp, Grunt or Webpack. 
   It's not something that can be demonstrated with CSS code. */

/* Performance optimization */
/* This is a broad topic that includes techniques like efficient use of selectors, 
   minimizing HTTP requests, using shorthand properties, etc. 
   It's not something that can be demonstrated with a single block of CSS code. */

/* Cross-browser Compatibility */
/* Vendor prefixes - for demonstration */
.box {
    -webkit-border-radius: 5px; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
    -moz-border-radius: 5px; /* Firefox */
    border-radius: 5px; /* Standard syntax */
}

/* Browser-specific CSS hacks */
/* This is generally not recommended, but sometimes necessary. 
   It's not something that can be demonstrated with a single block of CSS code. */

/* Modernizr */
/* This is a JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the userâ€™s browser. 
   It's not something that can be demonstrated with CSS code. */
