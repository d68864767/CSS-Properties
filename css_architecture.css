/* Scalable CSS architecture */

/* A scalable CSS architecture is one that is easy to maintain and grow over time. 
   It typically involves a specific methodology or approach to writing and organizing your CSS. 
   Here are a few examples of methodologies that can help create a scalable CSS architecture: */

/* BEM (Block Element Modifier) */
/* BEM is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in CSS. 
   The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. 
   This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it helps to create a scalable and reusable solution. */

/* Example of BEM methodology */
/*
.block {
  color: #333;
}

.block__element {
  color: #666;
}

.block--modifier {
  color: #999;
}
*/

/* SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) */
/* SMACSS is a style guide that follows five categories for your CSS rules: Base, Layout, Module, State, and Theme. 
   This is a more flexible guide than others as it allows for a lot of customization in your setup. */

/* Example of SMACSS methodology */
/*
/* Base */
body, form {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

/* Layout */
.l-container {
  margin: 0 auto;
}

/* Module */
.m-nav {
}

/* State */
.is-hidden {
  display: none;
}

/* Theme */
.theme-dark {
  background: #333;
  color: #fff;
}
*/

/* Atomic CSS */
/* Atomic CSS is a methodology that involves breaking down styles into atomic, or indivisible, pieces. 
   Each class does one thing, and one thing only. 
   This leads to a large number of very small classes, but can lead to very clean and maintainable CSS. */

/* Example of Atomic CSS methodology */
/*
.p-10 {
  padding: 10px;
}

.mt-20 {
  margin-top: 20px;
}

.bg-red {
  background-color: red;
}

.color-white {
  color: white;
}
*/

/* Note: These are just examples and the actual implementation will depend on the specific needs of your project. 
   The key to a scalable CSS architecture is consistency and clear guidelines. */
