/* Protecting against CSS vulnerabilities */

/* Be careful with the use of expressions, behaviors, and HTC files in your CSS, as they can open up security holes. 
   These are features specific to Internet Explorer and are not recommended for use. */

/* Content Security Policy (CSP) */

/* Content Security Policy is a security layer that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, 
   like Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from 
   data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. 

   CSP is designed to be fully backward compatible (except for specific clearly-defined high-risk situations); 
   browsers that don't support it still work with servers that implement it, and vice-versa: browsers that don't 
   support CSP simply ignore it, functioning as usual, defaulting to the standard same-origin policy for web content.

   If the server is properly configured and a CSP header is sent, then the browser will only load resources (images, 
   styles, scripts, etc.) from the locations specified in the header. 

   This is not something that can be demonstrated with CSS code, as it's a server-side setting. */
